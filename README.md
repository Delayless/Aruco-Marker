# Aruco-Marker
This code can make, detect, and estimate pose based on [ArUco Marker](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/d6d/tutorial_table_of_content_aruco.html) using OpenCV and OpenCV Contrib.
## Contents
* `test1` is to make ArUco markers based on the dictionary in OpenCV.
* `test2` is to detect ArUco markers and draw boxes of marker contours.
* `test3` is to do pose estimation of ArUco markers. This is why the markers are ceated.  

**Note: For `test2`, only when you know the dictionary of the ArUco marker, can you detect the marker as expected.**
**Version: OpenCV 3.2.0 && OpenCV Contrib 3.2.0**
